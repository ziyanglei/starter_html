            <h2>My Favorite Pets</h2>
            <h3>My 1st pet</h3>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">
            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>

            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <h3>My 2nd pet</h3>
            <img src="images/santa1.jpg" width = "400" alt="a dark cat lay down">
            <p>Santa is not your typical feline companion. With his luscious fur resembling freshly fallen snow and those twinkling emerald eyes that seem to hold the secrets of the North Pole, he's a cat that brings a touch of enchantment into every room he enters. Santa's personality is equally charming; he's both mischievous and affectionate. Whether he's playfully batting at a dangling ornament or curling up in your lap on a chilly winter's night, he never fails to bring warmth and joy to your home. His presence during the holiday season feels like a magical gift, a reminder that even in the busiest times, there's room for a little wonder and cuddles</p>

            <P>But Santa's mystique extends beyond his appearance and demeanor. He has an uncanny knack for finding hidden spots where he can observe the world from a safe distance, as if he's keeping a watchful eye over the household. And during the festive season, you can count on him to make the holiday decorations his personal playground, ensuring that no tinsel or ribbon goes unexplored. Santa is more than just a pet; he's a cherished member of the family who brings an extra dose of cheer and enchantment to every day, making your home feel like a year-round winter wonderland.</P>

            <P>Beneath her sophisticated exterior lies a heart filled with warmth and affection. Smoothie has an uncanny ability to sense when you need a comforting nudge or a gentle purr to ease your worries. Her purring, like a soft and melodious symphony, has the power to melt away stress and make even the busiest of days feel tranquil.
